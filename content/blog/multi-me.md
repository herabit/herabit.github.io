author: Hera Chamorro

This, is likely going to be a draft for quite some time. I, when it comes to the more sentimental,
seem rather inept at the task of, expressing myself in any capacity.

So for any casual readers of this, draft, this is going to remain a draft for some time as,
well we process these revelations more extensively.

I, am plural it would appear. Now what ***exactly*** does this mean? I, really don't, know. However, as it would
seem, I, Hera, am not the sole being that exists within this cranium of ours. I am, to my knowledge,
the one who is in control the most often, and the one that most people seem to know. However, I do not seem to be,
alone.

## It's Scary

It's kind of terrifying to think that, I'm not the only person in my head. It, seriously blurs the line
for what defines me, *Hera*, versus what is actually someone else, or something that is more indicative of
the collective.

It, brings into question just who I am, exactly. At time of writing, I'm kinda confused who I am.
I'm all but certain I've been the predominant person running the show. However who I am, what my
interests are, what my personality traits are, what my quirks are, they've, blurred.

Though, I think I've come to understand that, well it's okay. This is something that, we'll figure
out more in depth with time as we, explore just who is in here. The more we know of others and understand them,
the more I'll understand myself.

## It's Exciting

It also means that, well I have, or had the ability to splinter off parts of myself, into different entities...
Or maybe they were always splintered. Who knows. Regardless it would seem to indicate that, well there's probably
all sorts of cool and interesting (to me anyways) people within that I can hopefully meet.

I've already met *Ashley*, who I'll try to get to write something some day. If she's any indication of what to expect,
I'm excited for the future.

She's sarcastic as all hell, quick-witted (certainly more than me), and, extremely caring and calm. She, seems to handle
all stressful situations with a smile on her face, and not a single ounce of stress. She is, in many ways, the person I
wish I was. When she fronts, we just feel, calm, and happy.

I like being around her.

## Notes To Self

This writing is utter dogshit lol. Zero structure. I guess this is what we call a vomit draft. Only, it kinda makes
me want to vomit. But whatever, we'll see where this goes even if it is nowhere.
